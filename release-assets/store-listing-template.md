```
RIVR puts the power of the NOAA National Water Model in your pocket. Monitor real-time river flow conditions, assess flood risk, and view short-, medium-, and long-range forecasts for rivers and streams across the United States.

REAL-TIME RIVER FLOW DATA
Track current flow conditions for over 2.7 million river reaches modeled by the National Water Model. See flow rates in cubic feet per second (cfs) or cubic meters per second (cms), with at-a-glance status indicators showing whether a river is flowing at normal, above-normal, or flood levels.

FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT
Understand flood risk instantly with return period analysis. RIVR compares current and forecasted flows against established flood thresholds (2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year return periods) to show you whether a river is at normal flow or approaching action, moderate, major, or extreme flood risk.

MULTI-RANGE FORECASTS
View forecasts at three time horizons:
- Short range: Detailed hourly forecasts for the next 18 hours
- Medium range: Daily forecasts extending out 10 days
- Long range: Extended outlook up to 30 days

Interactive charts display forecasted flow alongside return period thresholds so you can see at a glance when and if flood levels may be reached.

INTERACTIVE MAP
Explore rivers across the US on a fully interactive map powered by Mapbox. Search for rivers by name or location, tap any river reach to view current conditions, and discover new waterways in your area.

SAVE YOUR FAVORITES
Build a personalized list of rivers you care about. Save your favorite fishing spots, kayaking runs, or rivers near your home and community. Your favorites dashboard shows current conditions for all saved rivers at a glance.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
Receive alerts when rivers on your favorites list reach elevated flood risk levels. Stay informed about changing conditions without having to check the app constantly.

POWERED BY NOAA
RIVR uses data from the NOAA National Water Prediction Service and the National Water Model, operated by NOAA's Office of Water Prediction. Return period thresholds are provided by the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH). This means you get the same authoritative data used by professional hydrologists and emergency managers, presented in an accessible mobile format.

FREE TO USE
RIVR is completely free with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no paywalls. Built as a public service tool to democratize access to critical water data.

Whether you are a kayaker checking river levels before a trip, a homeowner monitoring flood risk near your property, a farmer tracking irrigation water supply, or an emergency manager assessing conditions across a region, RIVR gives you the data you need in a clean, fast, mobile-first experience.
```

**Character count:** ~2,250 (well within both store limits)

## Keywords (A -- Apple Only)
**Max 100 characters, comma-separated, no spaces after commas**

```
river,flow,flood,forecast,NOAA,water,stream,hydrology,gauge,creek,weather,discharge,level,monitor
```

**Character count:** 95

**Notes:**
- Do not repeat words from the app name or subtitle (Apple indexes those separately).
- Apple treats these as individual search tokens; order does not matter.
- Avoid trademarked terms unless you have rights (NOAA is a government agency, so using it is fine).
- Single words perform better than phrases.

## Category

### Google Play (G)
**Primary category:** Weather
**Secondary category (if available):** Maps & Navigation

**Notes:** Google Play allows one primary category. "Weather" is the best fit because the app provides environmental/hydrological data and forecasts. "Maps & Navigation" would be an alternative if Weather feels off.

### Apple App Store (A)
**Primary category:** Weather
**Secondary category:** Navigation

**Notes:** App Store Connect allows a primary and secondary category. Weather fits best for discoverability among users looking for environmental monitoring. Navigation is suitable as a secondary given the map-based exploration feature.
